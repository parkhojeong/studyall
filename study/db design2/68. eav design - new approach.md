* problem situation: product attribute should be added dynamically

setup
```sql
-- 슈퍼타입: 상품 공통 정보
CREATE TABLE product (
  product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
  price INT NOT NULL,
  category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL
);

-- 서브타입: 의류
CREATE TABLE product_clothing (
  product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  size VARCHAR(10),
  color VARCHAR(50),
  material VARCHAR(100),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(product_id)
);

-- 서브타입: 전자제품
CREATE TABLE product_electronics (
  product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  manufacturer VARCHAR(100),
  warranty_months INT,
  power_consumption VARCHAR(50),
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(product_id)
);

-- 서브타입: 도서
CREATE TABLE product_book (
  product_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  author VARCHAR(100),
  publisher VARCHAR(100),
  isbn VARCHAR(20),
  page_count INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product(product_id)
);
```

problem1 - category explosion
- furniture, food, cosmetics, car items, kitchen items, ..
- 50 counts category is added after 6 months

problem2 - dynamic attribute addition
- in clothing - origin, wash method, season
- in electronics - battery life, kc code,
- every week, a new attribute is added
all requirement need `alter table`

problem3 - unestimated attribute
- wine: winery, region, alcohol degree
- camping equipment: brand, weight, capacity

problem4 - attribute is different for the seller
suppose that multiple sellers register a product like open-market
- seller A wants "display size", "battery life"
- seller B wants "5g supported", "power consumption"
- seller C wants "color option", "warranty period"
attributes are different for sellers in the same category 

column definition is impossible for all requirements by sellers

* inheritance is proper or not.
proper case
- the subtype type is clear and limited (payment method-card/cash)
- subtype attributes are stable and not changing frequently
- subtype attributes require constraint
- join or query by subtype is required frequently
un-proper case
- subtype(category) would be added consistently
- attributes can be dynamically added, updated, removed
- the required attribute by category is not clear
- user(seller, admin) can define attribute by himself
- flexibility is important than data integrity
