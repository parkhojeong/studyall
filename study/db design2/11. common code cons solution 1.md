* for simplifying complex SQL, a common code name could be searched in application code
- basic idea
1. SQL query is used for common code
2. application code query by common code 
3. code name is translated in application code

1. SQL query
```sql
use my_shop4;
select 
    o.order_id,
    m.name as member_name,
    m.grade,
    o.order_status,
    o.total_amount
from orders o
join members m on o.member_id = m.member_id
order by o.order_id;
```

2. application code use SQL query
```sql
select code, name
from common_code_detail
where group_code = 'ORDER_STATUS';
```

3. code name is translated in application code
```
// ...
code.getCodeName("ORDER_STATUS", order.orderStatus);
```

pros
- SQL is simple
- application code is simple
- common code query logic is managed in one place 
cons
- a common code query is required every step2

- use IN clause
cons 
- application code is complex
- still additional query is required(network traffic)

- tradeoff summary
approach1: common code join in SQL

| pros                                | cons                                                       |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| by single query, all data is finded | SQL is complex                                             |
| network communication 1 time        | join is duplicated to many SQL                             |
| db can optimize                     | when common code table is changed, all SQL must be updated |

approach2: common code query in application code

| pros                                  | cons                                                         |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| SQL is simple                         | additional query is required(network communication increase) |
| common code find logic is centralized | n+1 problem can occur                                        |
| good maintainability                      | application code complexity increase                         |

* what is good for?
- if performance is important and SQL complexity is allowed, join in SQL 
- if maintainability is important and performance loss is acceptable, common code query in application code
