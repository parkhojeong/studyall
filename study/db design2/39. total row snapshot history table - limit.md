- problem1: size problem
all columns are saved. if one column is updated, all columns are saved
- problem2: unnecessary duplication 
name is changed, but other columns are saved duplicately
- problem3: what to change is not clear.
to know the diff between old and new is hard

Nevertheless, why all columns snapshot is used
reason1: recovery is easy
reason2: query is simple
reason3: various analysis is possible
reason4: storage cost was reduced

* summary: when to use snapshot history table
- it gets development productivity and production stability by using storage cost
- use it by default if there is no special reason

- pros: easy implementation, easy query, easy recovery
- cons: storage cost, unnecessary duplication
- conclusion: all column snapshot is reasonable choice if data size is very huge
