* more detail information
- what system is it changed in? (api server?, batch server?, admin page?)
- what ip address is it changed from?

* why audit column is needed?
modern system can change single data from multiple places.
1. admin page: admin directly change data
2. api server: update is done by an external system
3. batch server: regular batch job update data
4. mobile app: update is done in mobile app

```sql
create table product(
    source_system varchar(50),
    client_ip varchar(50),
)
```
- source_system: system that change the data(WEB_ADMIN, BATCH, MOBILE)
- client_ip: client ip address that change the data

```sql
insert into product (
  source_system, client_ip                   
) valuse (
    WEB_ADMIN, '192.168.1.1'
)
```


| source_system | description                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| WEB_ADMIN     | web admin page                   |
| WEB_USER      | web user page                    |
| MOBILE_APP    | mobile application               |
| API           | external API intergration        |
| BATCH         | batch system                     |
| MIGRATION     | data migration                   |
| MANUAL        | manual db job(dba direct update) |

pros
1. when a problem occurs, a system is specified
2. prepare audit: what ip address is changed from?

solving problem
1. who changed the data? solved
2. when the data is changed? solved
3. why the data is changed? -> solved(enhanced)
4. what is the previous value? -> not yet

* previous data
1. only last updated data existed - previous data is overwrited
2. previous data is lost
3. change count is not stored

* tracking request ID(correlation ID)
- in msa, consider tracking request id to track overall flow easily
  - ex. user request: user ordered but stock is not updated
    - if request_id is found in order system log, it can be used too in the product system log, payment system log, delivery system log
