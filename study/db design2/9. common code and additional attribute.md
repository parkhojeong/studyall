requirement: discount rate by member grade, fee rate by payment method

* approach1: column addition
```sql
alter table common_code_detail
add column attr1 varchar(100),
add column attr2 varchar(100),
add column attr3 varchar(100);

-- 회원 등급별 할인율 설정
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '0' WHERE group_code = 'MEMBER_GRADE' AND code = 'NORMAL';
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '5' WHERE group_code = 'MEMBER_GRADE' AND code = 'VIP';
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '10' WHERE group_code = 'MEMBER_GRADE' AND code = 'VVIP';

-- 결제 수단별 수수료율 설정
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '2.5' WHERE group_code = 'PAYMENT_METHOD' AND code = 'CARD';
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '0' WHERE group_code = 'PAYMENT_METHOD' AND code = 'BANK';
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '0' WHERE group_code = 'PAYMENT_METHOD' AND code = 'VIRTUAL';
UPDATE common_code_detail SET attr1 = '3.0' WHERE group_code = 'PAYMENT_METHOD' AND code = 'MOBILE';

select * from common_code_detail;
```

- problem: what attr1, attr2 does mean is not clear
- solution: attr1 information addition by group_code
```sql
ALTER TABLE common_code_group
ADD COLUMN attr1_name VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN attr2_name VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN attr3_name VARCHAR(50);

UPDATE common_code_group SET attr1_name = '할인율(%)' WHERE group_code = 'MEMBER_GRADE';
UPDATE common_code_group SET attr1_name = '수수료율(%)' WHERE group_code = 'PAYMENT_METHOD';
```

* approach2: entity-attribute-value pattern
- requirement
  - by member grade, additional attributes should be added.
    - discount_rate
    - point_rate
    - is_free_shipping: availability of free shipping offer benefit
    - is_priority_support: availability of priority support benefit
- problem: approach1 is limited

* summary
group design pros
- code is managed by group
- same code can be used in different group
  - ex. canceled(order_status, payment_status)
- code list by group is easy to find

core columns
- group_code
- code
- name
- sort_order
- use_yn

handling additional columns
- few attributes are added -> column addition
- many attributes are added -> entity-attribute-value pattern
