* if in the application, code is not used directly, the common_code table is enough

* case that in the application, common_code is used directly
```java
// pseudo code
boolean canCancel(Order order) {
    if(order.status == "ORDER" || order.status == "PAID") {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
important problem
1. bug by typo
2. when code is changed, tracking is hard
if ORDER is changed to RECEIVED, find ORDER string and change it
3. auto completion recommendation is not available
4. type safety is lost: compiler cannot check the code
