* when, what to use?
table-per-concrete-class
- normally not recommended
- for legacy system compatibility
single-table
- type is few, will be few
- attributes are few
- performance is very important
- null is allowed
join
- type is many or will be many
- attributes are many
- data integrity is important
- normalized structure is required

* practice guide
- the difference between types is big and local attributes are many -> join
- the difference between types is small, and local attributes are few -> single-table


* orm and practice development
- orm support join strategy and single-table strategy

* supertype-subtype model
- parent-child structure is called supertype-subtype
- supertype: super entity has attributes common to all subtypes
- subtype: subtype entity has attributes unique to itself
subtype pk is reuse supertype pk. so, complete 1:1 relationship.
