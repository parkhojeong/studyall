* why is common code required?
similar type of data is used duplicatedly
ex. order status, member grade, payment method

- problem situation - hard code usage
```sql
use my_shop4;
create table orders(
    order_id bigint primary key auto_increment,
    member_id bigint not null,
    order_status varchar(20) not null,
    total_amount int not null,
    created_at datetime not null
);

INSERT INTO orders (member_id, order_status, total_amount, created_at) VALUES
(1, '주문완료', 50000, '2026-01-15 10:30:00'),
(2, '결제완료', 75000, '2026-01-15 11:00:00'),
(3, '배송중', 30000, '2026-01-15 12:00:00'),
(1, '배송완료', 120000, '2026-01-14 09:00:00'),
(4, '주문취소', 45000, '2026-01-13 15:00:00');
```

order_status varchar(20) problems
1. data miss match
ex. A use 'ORDER COMPLETE', B use 'ORDER_COMPLETE', C use 'ORDER COMPLETED'
2. bug by typo
ex. insert into orders()
```sql
INSERT INTO orders (member_id, order_status, total_amount, created_at) VALUES
(7, '배송증', 55000, '2026-01-17 09:00:00'); -- '배송중'을 '배송증'으로 오타
```
3. changing order status is hard
changes(ORDER_COMPLETE -> ORDER_SUCCESS) makes many records order_status changed
4. display name and code name are put together
if English service is added? change is hard

solution - separate code and display name

* what is common code?
code value and display name that all systems use is stored in a center
code value is stored in db, display name is queried from a common code table

- pros
1. data consistency
2. easy to change display name
3. easy to support new language
4. centralized management
- all developers use the same code

* cases common code is used
1. status value
- order status: order, paid, shipping, delivered, cancel
- member status: active, dormant, withdrawn
- payment status: pending, completed, failed, refund
2. type
- member type: normal, vip, vvip
- product type: physical, digital, subscription
- payment type: card, bank, virtual, mobile
3. categorical data
- delivery method: quick, pickup
- question category: product, delivery, refund, etc
4. other code data
- gender: male, female
- day: mon, tue, wed, ... , sun

* summary
- hard code usage is a problem
- common code is a solution
