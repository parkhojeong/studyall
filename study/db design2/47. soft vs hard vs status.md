* practice tip: data management based on status
1. product 'delete' vs 'sale stopped'
2. order 'delete' vs 'cancelled'

* summary
1. status management: when data lifecycle is important
- example: product, order, delivery
- usage: use status without deleted_at
2. soft delete: whether data existed or not is important, it can be recovered
- example: comment, board, like, member(withdrawal)
- usage: use deleted_at without status
- notes: if member has status, consider status
3. hard delete: data is not valuable anymore
- example: cart item, log, temp data

* wrap up
- deletion is policy not technology(recovery/legalment/audit/analysis/integrity)
- core domain(order/payment/delivery/settlement) should be managed by status
- soft delete is easy but high-cost(query/index/human error/sizeweight)
