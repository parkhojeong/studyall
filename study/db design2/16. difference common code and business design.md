* why common_code doesn't use surrogate key
1. data readability
- order_status = 'ORDER', 'CANCEL'
- order_status = 1,2,3
2. application mapping ease
- mapped by 'ORDER', 'CANCEL'
- if use surrogate key, mapped by 1, 2, 3
summary
- use natural key in common_code

* why common_code doesn't use foreign key
1. composite key structure problem
- orders table has composite key (group_code, common_code)
  - all order has same group_code(ORDER_STATUS)
2. performance and flexibility problem
- foreign key affected to write performance
- common_code is valid by application layer. data integrity is guaranteed

* conclusion
- common_code table has meta-data characteristics for reference
- manage integrity by application layer
