* case expression - grouping

- requirement: users, group by 1990's, 1980's, previous years. how many user in each group?
approach
1. classification: by case expression, 1990's, 1980's, previous years 
2. aggregation: group by result of classification, then count()
```sql
select
    case
        when year(birth_date) >= '1990' then '1990s'
        when year(birth_date) >= '1980' then '1980s'
        else 'previous years'
        end as birth_decade,
    count(*)
from users
group by
    case
        when year(birth_date) >= '1990' then '1990s'
        when year(birth_date) >= '1980' then '1980s'
        else 'previous years'
    end; 
-- group by birth_decade - MySQL support
