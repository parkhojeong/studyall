* summary

* JOIN
- INNER JOIN: intersection of two tables
- LEFT OUTER JOIN: only left table + intersection of right table
  - RIGHT OUTER JOIN: inverse of LEFT OUTER JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN: all rows of both tables. 
  - MySQL doesn't support FULL OUTER JOIN.

* OUTER JOIN 1
- include all of the base table
- if on condition is false, null is attached
- LEFT JOIN: left is base table

* OUTER JOIN 2
- A LEFT JOIN B = B RIGHT JOIN A
- recommend LEFT JOIN for readability

* JOIN characteristics
- row count increase case by pk-fk direction
- fk(N) -> pk(1): row count not increase 
- pk(1) -> fk(N): row count can increase
- for using aggregate function, predict row count changes after join

* SELF JOIN
- table join itself
- for hierarchical relationship, self-referencial relationship
  - ex. employee's manager info
    - for including employee who doesn't have manager, use LEFT JOIN
- use alias for self-join

* CROSS JOIN
- combine all rows of two tables
- ex. insert into ... select

* join total practice
- split problem into smaller problems
