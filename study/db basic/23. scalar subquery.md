* scalar subquery
- subquery result is single row, single column
- scalar means single value in math, physics

- requirement: find users who live in the address, address is that user having order_id = 1 live in
```sql
select *
from users u 
where address = (
    select u.address
    from users u
             join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id
    where o.order_id = 1
);
```
query execution flow
1. subquery execution. return single value '서울시 강남구'
2. change main query `WHERE address = '서울시 강남구'`
3. execute main query

* pros
- application-to-database network transmission is reduced to one time

* scalar subquery critical error
- if subquery return two or more rows?
```sql
select address from users where name in ('션', '네이트');
-- address: '서울시 강남구', '경기도 성남시'


select *
from users u 
where address = (select address from users where name in ('션', '네이트'));
-- Error Code: 1242. Subquery returns more than 1 row
```

- caution: must be scalar for single row comparison operator(=, >, <)
  - ex. subquery's condition with pk, unique column
