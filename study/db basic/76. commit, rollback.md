* commit, rollback
- 3 commands control transaction
1. start transaction
2. commit: transaction end and success
3. rollback: stop transaction and rollback

* practical tip: MySQL autocommit
- default is on. 
- each sql statement is a transaction. if sql statement success, auto commit
- if execute `start transaction` manually, autocommit temparily is off

* word 'session'
- db client has a logical connection unit from connected to ended
- session has an independent work space. transaction in a session is valid only in the session
