* why data integrity is important
- if you print a monthly sales report, 
  - total price is minus
  - you find price has minus, quantity is minus
  - we have 5 users. but orders table has user_id 99
- this data is called garbage data

- Garbage In, Garbage Out
  - if garbage data is stored in a database, it is a disaster

* garbage data makes disaster
- wrong business decision: we can't plan the next business plan by reporting having minus total price
- critical system error: application code is made as product price is always positive. when code encounter minus, system error occurs
- data mismatch: though we delete user_id 99 in users table, but orders table still has user_id 99

* database has responsibility to prevent garbage data
- application code could have bug
- various application access one database
- admin or developer could change data directly in database

* database keep data integrity(correctness, consistency, and validity of data)
  - for forcing data integrity, apply rule(constraints) to column
