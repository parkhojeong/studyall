* index cons and caution

* index cons
1. storage
- index store disk
- normally about 10% of original data size. ex. 100MB -> 10MB
2. write performance issue(insert, update, delete)
- index increases read performance, but decreases write performance.
- when data is changed, original data and related index must be updated.
  - insert: if new data is inserted, add data to all index
    - ex. suppose index count is 5, insert table(1 count), insert index(5 count)
  - delete: remove data and all index
  - update: complex
    - if column is not indexed, index is not updated.
    - if column is indexed, index is updated.
      - it is like delete and insert because keep sort order.
      - stress is huge

* practice guide
1. analyze workload: read vs write
- read-heavy service: index creation is recommended. ex, blog, news
- write-heavy service: if frequent insert or update is occured, be careful about index creation. ex. chat service, logging system, stock market
2. index creation when needed
3. index deletion when not needed anymore
  - monitor index usage. db provide monitoring tool.
