* subquery vs JOIN
- requirement: show orders are ordered by user living in 서울

* solution1: subquery
approach
1. find user_id living in 서울
2. find orders where user_id is in the list
```sql
select * 
from orders o
where o.user_id in (select user_id from users where address like '서울%');
```

* solution2: JOIN
approach
1. join tables
2. filter by condition
```sql
select * from orders o
join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id
where u.address like '서울%';
```

* performance vs readability : practice guide
- performance: normally, db join is faster or same as subquery
  - reason is query optimizer
    - join is more infomration 
    - subquery execute by multiple stages
  - but, recent db optimizer can smartly optimize subquery. transform to join
- readability
  - subquery: divided to logical stage 
  - join: clear structure, overall view

* conclusion: when, what to use? 
practice guideline
1. consider join first
2. use subquery if very verbose by join, or subquery has more readability
  - case for good readability by inline view
3. consider EXISTS
  - IN subquery alternatives, use EXISTS operator
4. must measure performance
  - EXPLAIN
