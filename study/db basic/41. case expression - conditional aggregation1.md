* case expression - conditional aggregation1

- requirement: report creation by sql, seems like excel's pivot table
  +--------------+-----------------+---------------+---------------+
  | total_orders | completed_count | shipped_count | pending_count |
  +--------------+-----------------+---------------+---------------+
  |            7 |               4 |             2 |             1 |
  +--------------+-----------------+---------------+---------------+

approach 1: union
1. find status, count(*), group by status
```sql
select status, count(*) 
from orders
group by status;
```
2. find count(*)
```sql
select count(*) from orders;
```
3. union 1,2
```
+-----------+-------+
| status    | count |
+-----------+-------+
| COMPLETED |     4 |
| SHIPPED   |     2 |
| PENDING   |     1 |
| total     |     7 |
+-----------+-------+
```

approach 2: subquery
```sql
select 
	(select count(*) from orders) as total_orders,
    (select count(*) from orders where status = 'COMPLETED') as completed_count,
    (select count(*) from orders where status = 'SHIPPED') as shipped_count,
    (select count(*) from orders where status = 'PENDING') as pending_count
```
problem 
  - read orders table 4 times, performance issue
  - not SQL standard
