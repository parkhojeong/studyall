* multi row subquery
- requirement: show all order list, order product in category '전자기기'
```sql
select *
from orders
where product_id in (
	select product_id
	from products
	where category = '전자기기'
);
```
* query execution flow
1. sub query result (1,2,3,6)
2. main query: where product_id in (1,2,3,6)
3. execute main query

* ANY, ALL 
- commonly used with >, <
- ANY: one row true, return true 
- ALL: all rows true, return true

* problem 1: price > any('전자기기' category price)
- select price from products where category = '전자기기'
- select * from products where price > any (subquery)
```sql
select *
from products
where price > any(select price from products where category = '전자기기')
```

* problem 2: price > all('전자기기' category price)

* practice tips: comparison with MIN, MAX
- MIN, MAX instead of ANY, ALL
  - price > (select min(price) from products where category = '전자기기')
    - price > any(select price from products where category = '전자기기')
  - price > (select max(price) from products where category = '전자기기')
    - price > all(select price from products where category = '전자기기')
- MIN, MAX is the same as ANY, ALL
- commonly use MIN, MAX than ANY, ALL
