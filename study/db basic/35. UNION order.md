* UNION ORDER
- use ORDER BY after last UNION

* use alias
- for readability
  - alias same positioned column
  - ex. created_at, retired_date -> event_date
```sql
select name, email, created_at as event_date from users
union
select name, email, retired_date as event_date from retired_users
order by event_date; -- after every union
```
