* summary
- CASE expression basic1
  - dynamic condition logic tool
  - simple case, searched case
    - simple case : case column when value then result
      - simple comparison
    - searched case : case when condition then result
      - complex comparison
    - evaluation order is from top to bottom
- CASE expression basic2
  - when clause order is important using searched case
  - use case expression in select, order by, group by, where
- CASE expression - grouping
  - classify data using case expression with group by
  - 2 stages
    - 1st stage(classification) : attach classification label to each row
    - 2nd stage(aggregation) : by 1st stage label, group by and aggregate
  - case expression alias in select clause is used in group by(MySQL support)
- CASE expression - conditional aggregation1
  - conditional aggregation : use with sum, count
  - transform row to column like pivot table
  - subquery has performance issue, but case is efficient
- CASE expression - conditional aggregation2
  - conditional aggregation: commonly use pattern that count(case ...) or sum(case ...)
    - COUNT(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 END): count 1 if condition is true, else null. count exclude null
    - SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 value END)
  - if use conditional aggregation in group by, can create a result like order count by category, status
