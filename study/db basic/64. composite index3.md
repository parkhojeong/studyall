* composite index3

```sql
explain 
    select * 
    from items 
    where category >= '패션' and price = 20000;

create index idx_items_price_category_temp on items(price, category);
```
- idx_items_price_category_temp is used (price = 20000 and category >= '패션')
- price equality comparison(1) and category range scan(2)

- change `category >= '패션'` to `category in ('패션', '헬스/뷰티')`
```sql
explain 
    select * 
    from items 
    where category in ('패션', '헬스/뷰티') and price = 20000;
```
* optimizer execution mechanism
1. recognize `where category in ('패션', '헬스/뷰티')` as `where category = '패션' or category = '헬스/뷰티'`
2. traslated to (category = '패션' and price = 20000) or (category = '헬스/뷰티' and price = 20000)
3. by idx_items_category_price, find ('패션', 20000) - equality comparison
4. by idx_items_category_price, find ('헬스/뷰티', 20000) - equality comparison
conclusion: in operator is equality comparison

* practice tips
- recommend to use in operator instead of range operator
- ex. status column has 3 values: 'A', 'B', 'C'. then use in ('B', 'C')
- using in with large data, it could be slow
