* problem and solution

* problem1: find most expensive product
- products table, most expensive product
- select product_id, name, price
- use scalar subquery in where clause
```sql
select
    product_id, name, price
from products
where price = (select max(price) from products);
```

* problem2: select order of same product
- product of order_id = 1, find order that has same product
- except order_id = 1
- select order_id, user_id, order_date
- use scalar subquery
```sql
select order_id, user_id, order_date
from orders 
where product_id = (select product_id from orders where order_id = 1)
and order_id != 1;
```

* problem3: total order count by user
- by user, get total_order_count
- select name, total_order_count
- order by user_id
- include user who has not ordered
- use correlation subquery in SELECT clause
```sql
select name as user_name, 
	(select count(*) 
    from orders o 
    where o.user_id = u.user_id) as total_order_count
from users u
order by user_id;

```
