* index and equality comparison
- index usage 3 cases
1. equality comparison(=)
2. range search(BETWEEN, >, <, LIKE, etc)
3. sorting for ORDER BY

* index equality comparison
```
+----+------+--------------------+--------------------+------+----------+-------+
| id | type | possible_keys      | key                | rows | filtered | Extra |
+----+------+--------------------+--------------------+------+----------+-------+
| 1  | ref  | idx_items_item_name| idx_items_item_name| 1    | 100.00   | NULL  |
+----+------+--------------------+--------------------+------+----------+-------+
```
- `type: ref` : equality comparison using index. ref = reference
- `possible_keys` : candidate for index
- `key: idx_items_item_name` use index
- `filtered: 100.00`: choose single row searched by index
- `rows: 1`: single row to read
- `Extra: NULL`: before value of `Using where` is changed to NULL. enough to use index
- conclusion: by index, we can search by equality comparison

* important
- with small data, db doesn't use index and use full table scan instead.
- FORCE INDEX(idx_name): force to use index
  - ex. `SELECT * FROM items FORCE INDEX(idx_items_item_name)`
  - caution: not recommended, use carefully
