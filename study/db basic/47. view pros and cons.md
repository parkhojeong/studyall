* view pros and cons

* view pros
1. easy to use, reusability
- client: easy to use
- developer: high reusability, maintainability 
2. security
- practice: most important reason why to use view. view provide detail access control
  - hide sensitive column
  - expose specific row
- without access permission to original table, expose data only needed
3. logical data independence
- view is a kind of abstraction layer

* view cons
1. performance issue
hide expensive query
- mistake: client mistake that a light query executed, but actually a heavy query executed 
- optimization limitation: if view structure is too complex, it will be hard to optimize
  - nested views is common case. avoid nested views
2. modification restriction
deal view with table, but is focused on read
- modification impossible(common case): can't modify view using join, aggregate function, group by, distinct
- modification possible: view reference one table, all column directly reference real column. in this case, original table row is changed
- practice rule: "view is for read only". if you need to modify row, do it in original table instead of view
