* procedure, function, trigger
- requirement: when new user join, run works sequentially
  1. insert user info to users
  2. insert user profile info to user_profiles
  3. insert a new join coupon to coupons
  4. insert a new user join log to user_join_logs

- db provide program in database. it is stored procedure, stored function, trigger
1. stored procedure
  - definition: sql work bundle of named
  - characters: support parameter, control flow(if, loop).
  - usage: independently used `CALL procedure_name(param1, param2)`
2. stored function
  - definition: program that returns scalar
  - characters: unlike procedure, return scalar
  - usage: SELECT name, my_function(column_name) FROM users
3. trigger
  - definition: automatically run when certain event happens
  - characters: if specific event happens, db automatically run the trigger. event can be insert, update, delete
  - usage: when new order is inserted in orders, insert a log to logs

* why use them?
  - performance: reduce network communication
  - reusability and centralization: reuse consistent logic from multiple applications
  - security: user only has EXECUTE permission without directly accessing db
