* db logic cons and recent alternatives
- cons
  1. hard to maintain: spread logic into application and database
    - hard to trace and debug
    - hard to manage version, test, deploy
  2. performance and scalability issue
    - cpu bottleneck can occur in db
    - db hard to scale horizontally(scale out). but an application can scale out easily
  3. dependency to specific db
    - technical debt and vendor lock-in
    - procedural sql defers from vendors
      - Oracle: PL/SQL
      - PostgreSQL: PL/pgSQL
      - MySQL: own grammar
- recent alternatives: clear separation of roles
  - application layer: business logic
  - database layer: store and retrieve data
- conclusion: consider very carefully putting logic in db
  - special case
    - batch processing to large data in data warehousing environment
    - dba work processing
