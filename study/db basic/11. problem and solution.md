* problem and solution

* problem1: from order, join product
- from orders join products,
- select orders.order_id, products.name, orders.quantity
- order by orders.order_id
- alias orders o, products p
```sql
select 
    o.order_id as 'order id',
    p.name as 'product name',
    o.quantity as 'order quantity'
from orders o 
    join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
order by o.order_id;
```

* problem2: join 3 table
- join orders, users, products
- where orders.status = 'SHIPPED'
- select orders.order_id, users.name, products.name, orders.order_date
```sql
select
    o.order_id,
    u.name as user_name,
    p.name as product_name,
    o.order_date
from
    orders o 
        join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
        join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id
where o.status = 'SHIPPED';  
```

* problem3: total price by user calculation
- use INNER JOIN, aggregate function
- sum(quantity * price) per user
- select user_name, total_purchase_amount
- order by sum(quantity*price)
```sql
select
    u.user_id,
    u.name as user_name,
    sum(o.quantity * p.price) as total_purchase_amount
from users u
    join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id
    join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
group by u.user_id
order by total_purchase_amount desc;
```
