* outer join 2

* practice2: product that is not ordered
```sql
select
    p.product_id,
    p.name,
    o.order_id
from products p
left join orders o on p.product_id = o.product_id
where o.order_id is null;
```

* practice3: by right join, get the product that is not ordered

```sql
select 
    *
from orders o
right join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
where o.order_id is null;
```

* practice tip: recommend left join than right join for readability
