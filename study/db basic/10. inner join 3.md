* inner join 3

* practice tips: when join order is important
- start with orders, from orders join users
- start with users, from users join orders
- ex. orders where status = 'COMPLETED', and users -> from orders join users

* table alias for readability
- from table_name (as) alias_name
  - recommend as omitted  
- ex. from orders as o join users as u
```sql
select 
    o.order_id,
    u.name
from orders o join users u
```

* practical tips
- table alias without as
  - ex.
    - select * from orders o join users u(recommanded)
    - select * from orders as o join users as u 
- column alias with as 
  - ex. 
    - select price * 12 annual_price(not recommanded)
    - select price * 12 as annual_price(recommanded)
