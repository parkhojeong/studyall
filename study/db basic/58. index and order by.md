* index and sort
- order by for large data is a heavy operation
- if `order by` use index, only read data without filesort
  - filesort: sort data in memory or on disk

```sql
explain 
    select *
    from items 
    where price between 50000 and 100000
    order by price;
```
```
+----+-------+-----------------+------+----------+-----------------------+
| id | type  | key             | rows | filtered | Extra                 |
+----+-------+-----------------+------+----------+-----------------------+
| 1  | range | idx_items_price | 5    | 100.00   | Using index condition |
+----+-------+-----------------+------+----------+-----------------------+
```
- without filesort, order by is done

* scan index backward
```sql
explain 
    select * 
    from items 
    where price between 50000 and 100000
    order by price desc;
```
```
+----+-------+-----------------+------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| id | type  | key             | rows | filtered | Extra                                 |
+----+-------+-----------------+------+----------+---------------------------------------+
| 1  | range | idx_items_price | 5    | 100.00   | Using index condition;                |
|    |       |                 |      |          | Backward index scan                   |
+----+-------+-----------------+------+----------+---------------------------------------+
```
- Backward index scan: scan direction is backward

* practice tips
- because hardware prefetching, forward scan is better than backward scan
  - performance is a little different
- filesort is more important!! 

* Descending index(since MySQL 8.0 supported)
```sql
create index idx_items_price_desc on items(price DESC);
```

* practice tips
- for single column index, performance is a little different
- for compound column index, performance can be better
