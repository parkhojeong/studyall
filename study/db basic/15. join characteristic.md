* join characteristic

* row count increase case

* pk, fk
- pk: unique in table
- fk: duplicate in table

- parent table: table with pk (users, products)
- child table: table with fk (orders)

1. child -> parent join: row count can't increase
  - orders join users: order row reference one user 
2. parent -> child join: row count can increase
  - users join orders: user has many orders

* user seon case
- user
user_id(pk)  name     email
1            sean     sean@example.com

- order
order_id(pk) product_id  user_id(fk)
1            1           1
2            4           1

- predict below sql
```sql
-- from users
select *
from users u
where u.user_id = 1;

select *
from users u
join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id
where u.user_id = 1;

-- from orders
select *
from orders o
where o.user_id = 1;

select *
from orders o
join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id
where o.user_id = 1;
```

- predict below sql
```
-- users
user_id , name
'1'     ,'션'
'2'     ,'네이트'
'3'     ,'세종대왕'
'4'     ,'이순신'
'5'     ,'마리 퀴리'
'6'     ,'레오나르도 다빈치'

-- orders
order_id, user_id
'1'     ,'1'
'2'     ,'1'
'3'     ,'2'
'7'     ,'2'
'4'     ,'3'
'5'     ,'4'
'6'     ,'5'
```
```sql 
-- from users
select user_id, name from users;

select user_id, name 
from users u
join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id;

-- from orders
select order_id, user_id from orders;

select order_id, user_id
from orders o
join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id;
```

* summary
- row count stay: fk -> pk join(to-One)
- row count can increase: pk -> fk join(to-Many)

* why is it important?
- count user that order
  - select count(u.user_id) from users join orders -> row count can increase based on users
  - exactly should predict result by join. before using aggreate function
  - what table based on join? case that can increase row count?

* memo: join flexibility
- join condition
  - fk-pk: commonly used
  - same data type comparision: be careful 
    - ex. on a.order_date = b.event_date
