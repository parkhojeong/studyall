* view introduction
- query reuse problem
  - complexity: hard to understand
  - reusability: copy and paste
  - security: table access permission

* view concept
- virtual table
- shortcut: store select query 
- user `select * from my_view`

* view execution mechanism
when user execute `select * from my_view`
1. user execute `select * from my_view`
2. find select query in view definition
3. db execute select query
4. user get result
-> when execute view, execute query from current table. so, view always return current data

* view requirement
1. easy to use: simplify complex query to simple view 
2. security: user has no original table access permission. sensitive data is hidden
3. logical abstraction: support abstraction. user only depends on view
- view provides not only easy to use, but also security and logical abstraction
