* covering index

* when using index, how to skip random i/o?
- covering index is solution

* covering index
- if index has column data, random i/o is not needed.

* example: before and after using covering index
```sql
explain 
select item_id, price, item_name 
from items 
where price between 50000 and 60000;
```
- `Extra: Using index condition` -> means that additional work(data access) is needed

```sql
explain 
select item_id, price 
from items 
where price between 50000 and 60000;
```
- `Extra: Using where; Using index` 
  - using index: means that all data is readed from index
  - using where: means that filtering is done in index scan stage
conclusion
  - by covering index, avoid access original data(extra: using index)
  - filtering is done in index scan stage(extra: using where)
  - so, query is very efficient.

* covering index applying - add item_name
- caution: in the compound index, the order of columns is important.
```sql
drop index idx_items_price_name on items;
create index idx_items_price_name on items(price, item_name);

explain
select item_id, price, item_name
from items
where price between 50000 and 60000;
```
- item_name is covered in index scan stage. random i/o for item_name is not needed.

* covering index pros and cons
- pros
  - select performance increased. random i/o skipped 
  - count() query optimized: only index scan is needed
- cons
  - index volume increased
  - write performance decreased

* when to use covering index?
consider tradeoff between read performance and write performance.
- apply table that read very frequently, write rarely
- when select column count is small. select * is not recommended.
- for tuning specific query that have performance issue
