* join practice
- requirement
  - all order by user that in 2025-06, live in '서울'
  - user name, user email, order date, product name, product price, order quantity
  - order by order_date desc


* problem analysis and solution approach
1. what information i need?
- user name, user email -> users
- order date, order quantity -> orders
- product name, product price -> products
- related on order information -> start with orders
2. what table i need?
- users
- orders
- products
3. filtering condition
- condition 1: 2025-06 order - orders
- condition 2: '서울' address - users
4. what is sort order?
- recent order first - orders order_date desc

```sql
select
    u.name as user_name, 
    u.email,
    o.order_date,
    p.name as product_name,
    o.quantity
from orders o
    join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id
    join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
where
    address LIKE '서울%' and
    order_date >= '2025-06-01' and order_date < '2025-07-01'
order by 
    order_date desc;
```

* caution
- BETWEEN 
  - '2025-06-01' AND '2025-06-30' 
    - convetred to '2025-06-01 00:00:00' AND '2025-06-30 00:00:00'
    - conversion is not intended
  - '2025-06-01 00:00:00' AND '2025-06-30 59:59:59'
    - doesn't cover millisecond
