* multi column subquery
- requirement
  1. name(user_id=2) has order(order_id=3). 
  2. find order same user_id and order_status by 1
```sql
select user_id, status
from orders o
where order_id = 3;

select *
from orders
where (user_id, status) = (select user_id, status
                           from orders o
                           where order_id = 3);
-- and order_id != 3; -- exclude self
```

* caution
- must be one row. if not, error occur

* multi columns subquery and multi rows
- use IN operator instead of =
- example: by name, first(order_date) order
```sql
select *
from orders
where (user_id, order_date) in (select user_id, min(order_date)
								from orders
								group by user_id);

-- join
select 
    o.order_id,
    o.user_id,
    u.name,
    p.name as product_name,
    o.order_date
from orders o
join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id
join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
where (o.user_id, o.order_date) in (select user_id, min(order_date)
                                from orders
                                group by user_id);
```
