* summary
- why transaction is required
  - to make unit of work that can't be divided
  - provide all or nothing
- commit, rollback
  - command: start transaction, commit, rollback
  - MySQL: autocommit default is on. for transaction, use start transaction
- transaction acid property
  - transaction must be satisfied ACID
  - atomicity: all or nothing
  - consistency: after commit, db keep valid state(ex. constraint)
  - isolation: when multiple transaction run concurrently, one transaction can't affect another
  - durability: after commit, data must be persisted even if system failure
- transaction isolation level
  - definition: setup controlling between correctness and concurrency(performance)
  - concurrency problem type: dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom read
  - standard isolation level: read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, serializable
  - MySQL: innodb default is repeatable read. in huge traffic and rare non-repeatable read phantom read, consider using read committed
