* problem and solution 1

* problem1: find un ordered product with specific category 
- from products left join orders,
- where category = '전자기기'
- order_id is null
- select product_name, price
```sql
select
    p.name, p.price
from products p 
    left join orders o
    on p.product_id = o.product_id
where 
    category = '전자기기'
    and o.order_id is null;
```

* problem2: order count by user(including user doesn't order)
- user name and order count by user
- show 0 if user doesn't order
- order by user name asc
```sql
select
    u.name, 
    count(o.order_id) as order_count -- count() exclude null
from users u
    left join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id
group by u.user_id
order by u.name;
```

* problem3: by right join, find user who doesn't order
- using right join, user who doesn't order
```sql
select u.name, u.email
from orders o
right join users u on o.user_id = u.user_id
where o.order_id is null;
```

* problem4: find order list by user
- show all user name and order that user ordered
- if user orders 2 times or more, show all order's product name
- if user doesn't order, show null
- select user_name, product_name
- order by user_name, product_name
```sql
select
    u.name as user_name, p.name as product_name
from users u
left join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id
left join products p on o.product_id = p.product_id
order by u.name, p.name;
```
