* transaction acid property
- atomicity: all or nothing. transaction is a logical unit that can't be divided anymore
- consistency: after transaction success, database keeps consistent status(constraint, data integrity)
- isolation: transaction runs independently of others
  - dirty read: transaction reads uncommitted data
- durability: transaction committed, data will be saved
  - even if the system is down, keep stable because database stores a transaction log in storage(ssd, hdd).
