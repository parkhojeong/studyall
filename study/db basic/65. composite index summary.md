* composite index summary

* composite index general rule
1. use index sequentially(left prefix rule)
2. = condition first, range condition last
3. order by following the index order

1. use index sequentially
- if create index (a,b,c), can't use b or c without a 

ex.
- possible: a, a,b, a,b,c
- impossible: b, c, b,c

2. = condition first, range condition last
- if range condition is used, following column can't be indexed

ex. index (category, price) -> where category > '도서' and price = 30000
- price is not sorted in range by category > '도서'

- recommend: category in  ('도서', '생활용품') and price = 30000
1. use = condition first
2. range condition last

3. order by following the index order
- index (category, price) -> order by (category, price)
- fast case: where category ='전자기기' order by price
  - already sorted by category
- slow case(need filesort): where category = 전자기기' order by stock_quantity
  - not sorted by category 
  - if need query fast, create composite index

* conclusion
- composite index just is not creation, core that stragegic design considering order and condition type(equal/range)
- remember general rule!
