* SELECT
- SELECT: what to bring? (column)
  - * : all
  - column name : column selected
  - AS : alias column name
- FROM: where to bring? (table)

* SELECT * issue
1. performance decrease - stress dbms, speed slow down
2. readability decrease - show un needed column
3. network traffic waste - send more data from db to client
best practice: use specific column

* memo
- access db by client access tools like MySql Workbench

* AS needs?
- readability increase
- column name conflict avoid - when join table

* alias column name
- use column naming convention
- also can use backtick(`)
