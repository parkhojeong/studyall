* GROUP BY - caution
- if use GROUP BY, select grouping column, aggregate function

```sql
select
    category,
    count(*)
from order_stat
group by category;
```

- group by category, select product_name
```sql
select
    product_name, -- error
    category
from order_stat
group by category;
-- Error Code: 1055. Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'my_shop.order_stat.product_name' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by
```

```
order_id ,category      ,product_name
'1',     '전자기기',      '프리미엄 기계식 키보드'
'4',     '전자기기',      '고성능 게이밍 마우스'
'5',     '전자기기',      '4K 모니터'
'9',     '전자기기',      '노이즈캔슬링 블루투스 이어폰'
'10',    '전자기기',      '보조배터리 20000mAh'

GROUP BY category, row is grouped by category.
when grouped by category, which product_name is picked up?
to pick product_name is ambiguous.
so, not allowed to select product_name.
