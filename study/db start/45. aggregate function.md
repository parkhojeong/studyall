    count(category) as 'category count'
from order_stat;
```

## SUM(), AVG()
- SUM(column): sum of column value
- AVG(column): average of column value
- both exclude null
```sql
select
    sum(price * quantity) as 'total price',
    avg(price * quantity) as 'average price'
from order_stat;
```

```sql
select 
    sum(quantity) as 'total quantity',
    avg(quantity) as 'average quantity'
from order_stat;
```

## MAX(), MIN()
- MAX(column): max value of column
- MIN(column): min value of column
```sql
select 
    max(price) as 'max price',
    min(price) as 'min price'
from order_stat; 
```

```sql
select
    min(order_date) as 'first order date',
    max(order_date) as 'lastest order date'
from order_stat;
```

## DISTINCT: distinct customer count
- DISTINCT(column)
```sql
select
    count(customer_name) as 'total customer count',
    count(distinct customer_name) as 'distinct customer count'
