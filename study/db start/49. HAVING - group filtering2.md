* HAVING - group filtering2

* WHERE vs HAVING
- WHERE: filter row, aggregate function not allowed. before GROUP BY
- HAVING: filter group, aggregate function allowed. after GROUP BY

* complex example: use WHERE and HAVING together
- from order_stat, product that price >= 100,000(where), group category(group by), count >= 2(having)
- select category
```sql
select
    category,
    count(*)
from
  order_stat
where
  price >= 100000
group by
  category
having
  count(*) >= 2;
```

* stage 1: filter row
```sql
select * 
from order_stat 
where price >= 100000;
```

* stage 2: group by
```sql
select category
from order_stat 
where price >= 100000
group by category;
```

* stage 3: filter group
```
select category
from order_stat 
where price >= 100000
group by category
having count(*) >= 2;
```

* last stage: select category, count(*)
