* constraint condition usage
1. NOT NULL: column requirement

```sql
insert into customers(email, password, address)
values ('a@a', 'p', 'a');
-- Error Code: 1364. Field 'name' doesn't have a default value
```

2. UNIQUE
```sql
insert into customers(name, email, password, address)
values ('a', 'a@a', 'p', 'a');
-- Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry 'a@a' for key 'customers.email'
```

3. FK: maintain data integrity and consistency. referential integrity
```sql
insert into orders(customer_id, product_id, quantity)
values(999, 1, 1);
-- Error Code: 1452. Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`my_shop`.`orders`, CONSTRAINT `fk_orders_customers` FOREIGN KEY (`customer_id`) REFERENCES `customers` (`customer_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE)

delete from customers where customer_id = 1;
-- Error Code: 1451. Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`my_shop`.`orders`, CONSTRAINT `fk_orders_products` FOREIGN KEY (`product_id`) REFERENCES `products` (`product_id`))

```
