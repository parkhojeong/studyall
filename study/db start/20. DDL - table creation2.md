# table and column name rules
- normal rule(without backtick)
  - allow character
    - english alphabet(upper and lower)
    - number(0~9)
    - underscore(_)
    - dollar sign($)
    - UTF-8 character(ex. korean)
  - limitation
    - can't start with number
    - can't use reserved word(select, table, order, from)
    - length(max 64)
- extended rule(with backtick)
  - allow most character
    - space
    - hyphen(-) and special character(@)
    - start with number
