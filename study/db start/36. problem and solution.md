* problem and solution

# problem1: specific column selection and alias usage
- select name, price from products. column name is product_name, selling_price
```sql
SELECT name as product_name, price as selling_price
FROM products;
```

# problem3: complex condition filtering
- price > 10,000 and stock_quantity < 50 from products
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM products 
WHERE price > 10000 AND stock_quantity < 50;
```

# problem3: complex codition filtering
- from products, price >= 10,000 and stock_quantity < 50
```sql
SELECT * 
from products
where price >= 10000 AND stock_quantity < 50;
```

# problem4: specific range and list filtering
- select name, price from products where product_id in (2,3,4)

# problem5: characters pattern search(LIKE)
- from customers, where address starts with '서울특별시', select name, address
```sql
select name, address
from customers
where address like '서울특별시%';
```

# problem6: NULL value data selection(IS NULL)
- from products, description is null, select all columns
```sql
select * 
from products 
where description IS NULL;
```

# problem7: result sorting
- from products, select all columns, price desc
```sql
select *
from products
order by price desc;
```

# problem8: multiple conditions sorting
- from products, order by price asc, stock_quantity desc, select *
```sql
select *
from products
order by price asc, stock_quantity desc;
```

# problem9: selection result count limitation(LIMIT)
- from customers, recent join_date, limit 2, select *
```sql
select *
from customers
order by join_date desc
limit 2;
```

# problem10: duplication value removal and selection(DISTINCT)
- from orders, at least 1 order, select DISTINCT(customer_id, product_id)
```sql
select DISTINCT customer_id, product_id
from orders;
```

# problem11: all practical example
- from products, where price > 3000 and stock_quantity <= 100, order by stock_quantity desc, limit 3
- select name, stock_quantity
- name as `product name`, stock_quantity as `remaining quantity`
```sql
select name as `product name`, stock_quantity as `remaining quantity`
from products
where price > 3000 AND stock_quantity < 100
order by stock_quantity desc
limit 3;
```
