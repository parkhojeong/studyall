* database management requirement
- suppose that manage shopping service

* where to store data?
- human memory: limited and incorrect
- paper: risk of loss, hard to edit, hard to share
- computer file system
  - text file: separated by line, comma, /
    - hard to edit, hard to find
  - excel(spreadsheet): structured data, easy to edit
    - hard to manage complex data

* problem using file(store and manage data) 
1. data duplication and mismatch
  - ex. user 'nate' address in user.xlsx, dailyorder.xlsx
    -> could change only one file.
2. hard to access data
  - request "last month, user list buying shoes with seoul region address"
  - very hard to find and manipulate data
3. hard to apply data integrity constraint
  - request "product price is at least 0, order quantity is at least 1"
  - request "user id is unique"
4. concurrency control
  - request "premium keyboard stock is 1" and "admin1 and admin2 receive user request for premium keyboard"
  - admin1 and admin2 set stock 0
5. security issue
  - request "team1 can only access user info"
  - file system support permission limitedly.(read, write, execute)
6. recovery, backup issue
  - hard disk broken, employee delete file
  - hard to backup having data consistency. 
    - ex. during user1 order, hard disk broken. only save user info but payment info
  - file system support backup limitedly.(backup only file, not data consistency)

* data base management system provide solution 
1. keep data duplication minimization and consistency
2. variable and complex condition search
3. data integrity constraint
4. multiple user access data safely
5. precise security policy
6. backup and recovery when failure
