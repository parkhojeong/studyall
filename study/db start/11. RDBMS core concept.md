* RDBMS core concept
- table format
- row: each data
  - called record, tuple
- column: data type metadata
  - called field, attribute

* core concept
1. primary key(pk) - identify unique record
- principal
  - uniqueness: differ from other rows
  - not null: not empty
- purpose: quickly find specific data in many data
- practice: id column(table_id), from 1 to N, auto increment

2. foreign key - bind two tables
* parent and child 
  - two tables are related by foreign key. one is parent, the other is child
  - child refer to parent by fk. child has fk
* rules
  - referential integrity: child fk must exist in parent or be null
* why fk?
  - bind two tables logically separated
  - prevent duplication, maintain data consistency
