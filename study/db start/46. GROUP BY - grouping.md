* GROUP BY
- best order category? 
  - order count group by category?
  - total price group by category?
- best user?
  - total price and order count group by user?

* GROUP BY
- group by same column value

ex. order count group by category
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as 'order count'
from 
    order_stat
group by 
    category;
```
result below
```
category   `order count`
'전자기기'    '5'
'도서'       '2'
'가구'       '2'
'문구'       '1'
NULL        '1'
```

- count(*) group by customer name
```sql
select 
    customer_name,
    COUNT(*) as 'order count' 
from order_stat
group by customer_name;
```

* GROUP BY and Aggregation Function
ex scenario: find vip user 
- from order_stat, group by user_name
- select count(*), sum(price), sum(price*quantity)
- order by sum(price*quantity) desc

```sql
select 
    customer_name,
    count(*),
    sum(price),
    sum(price*quantity) as `total order price`
from order_stat
group by customer_name
order by `total order price` desc;
-- order by sum(price*quantity) desc;
```

* caution
- use backtick with order by instead of quote

* more detail grouping: multiple column grouping
- requirement: group by customer_name, group by category, count(*)?  
```sql
select
    customer_name,
    category,
    count(*) as 'order count'
from order_stat
group by customer_name, category;
```
