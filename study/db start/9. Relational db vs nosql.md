* relational db vs nosql
- point: efficient and safe manage data
- rdbms: most popular 
  - structured data based on relational between tables
- nosql: not only sql
  - bigdata and specific requirement

RDBMS
- store in table(structured format)
  - column, row
- why rdbms is basic?
  - structured data management
  - guarantee acid transaction 
  - easy use by SQL 
  - mature and most popular

NoSQL
- specific requirement(large unstructured data, very fast read/write, flexible data model)
- 4 types: (data unit, core pros, representative case, ex)
  - key-value store
    - key-value pair, fast single data r/w
    - session,cache, ex. redis,memcached
  - document db
    - json/bson document, flexible schema
    - product catalog, ex. mongodb, couchbase
  - column family store
    - column family/ bigtable/analytics,
    - log/time series data, ex. cassandra, hbase
  - graph db
    - node, edge, graph traversal
    - recommendation engine/anomaly detection, ex. neo4j

practice: introduce NoSQL
- RDB is enough good to 90%
- system introduction make management cost
- ex. redis introduction cost
  - server instance management
  - monitoring
  - data backup, data migration
