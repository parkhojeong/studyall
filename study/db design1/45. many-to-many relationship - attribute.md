* many-to-many relationship - junction table

* attributes and junction table
- junction table connects two tables, and stores additional attributes for relationship
- ex. user order product
  - at user order product, how much product price is paid? - snapshop
  - how many products are ordered? - count
  - these are not included in user and order, is included in associative entity

- associative entity naming recommendation
1. connection emphasis - order_product
2. meaningful name - order_item/ order_detail

```sql
create table orders(
    orders_id bigint not null primary key 
);
create table product(
    product_id bigint not null primary key 
);
create table order_item(
  order_item_id bigint not null primary key,
  orders_id bigint not null,
  product_id bigint not null,
  order_price int not null,
  order_quantity int not null,
  constraint fk_order_item_orders foreign key (orders_id) references orders(orders_id),
  constraint fk_order_item_product foreign key (product_id) references product(product_id)  
)
```
