* identifying vs non-identifying relationship - one-to-many

* example: board-comment
- board: strong entity
- comment: weak entity

- in a logical model, comment can or not inherit board pk
- if a comment inherits, a comment pk includes board pk
  - pros
    - pk has business meaning
    - data integrity
    - query optimization possibility
  - cons
    - pk is too long
    - low flexibility
    - low scalability
    - high orm mapping complexity
  - memo. comment_no has to be created in an application layer. comment_no cannot use auto_increment
- if a comment does not inherit, a comment pk is independent. comment just use board pk as fk
