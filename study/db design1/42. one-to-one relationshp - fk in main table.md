* one-to-one relationship - fk in main table

1. relationship optionality is mandatory
- lifecycle is same 
```sql
create table member(
    member_id     bigint primary key,
    member_detail bigint not null references member_detail (member_detail_id)
);                
create table member_detail(
    member_detail_id bigint primary key
);
```
- not null constraint implement mandatory
- when insert to member, member_detail_id is needed

* cases that use fk in a main table
1. data insertion order is sub -> main
2. mandatory of optionality is important
3. query frequency is very high
4. orm mapping convenience
