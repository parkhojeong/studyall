- user 
  - can have many orders(many)
  - can't have an order(optional)
- order must be included to user(mandatory) 

* word - de facto standard
- technology or product is widely used and standardized in practice. (not official standard)

* why is crow's foot notation popular?
1. high readability: can represent much information clearly in a small space
2. intuitive representation: many(<), one(|), cardinality(o,|) is simple
3. most tools support: MySQL workbench, dbeaver, erdcloud

* crow's foot notation symbols
- entity: rectangle
- relationship: line between entities
- cardinality and optionality: end of line
  - cardinality: <(many), |(one)
  - optionality: |(mandatory), o(optional)
  - combination
    - o< (optional, many): 0..n
    - |< (mandatory, many): 1..n
    - o| (optional, one): 0..1
    - || (mandatory, one): 1..1
