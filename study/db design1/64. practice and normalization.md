* normalization result
- member_3nf
- product_2nf
- orders_3nf
- order_item_2nf

* why normalization is required
- one cell has one information - atomic(1nf)
- one topic has related information 
  - one pk describes one topic - 2nf, 3nf
- duplicated information is managed in one place
  - 3nf

* in practice
- an approach to a model based on concept includes normalization rules
- normally 3nf, bcnf are used

* summary
- X -> Y, X functionally determine Y
  - X: Determinant, Y: Dependent
  - non-key attribute: not part of any candidate key
- 1nf: one cell contains an atomic value
- 2nf: if Y is a non-key attribute, X must be the entire pk, not part of pk
- 3nf: if Y is a non-key attribute, X must be a candidate key
- bcnf: in every FD, X should be candidate keys
