* identifying relationship problem

- important problem
  - low flexibility
    ex. for 1:1 -> 1:N, pk is changed
    ex. suppose any comment has to be another board, pk is changed  
  - pk spread to many tables
    - join is complex
    - orm is difficult

* non-identifying relationship
- pk uses artificial key
- fk: parent_id
- business data is not included in pk
