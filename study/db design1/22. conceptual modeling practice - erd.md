* why foreign key is omitted
- principle: design independent from specific technology(rdbms, nosql, etc)
  - foreign key: rdbms concept
  - conceptual model's goal: write pure logical structure of data
  - relationship representation: using line between entities

* practice: practicality approach
- predicting technology: rdbms
- efficiency: because finally fk is added, including fk is efficient in an early step
- in practice, almost fk is used in a conceptual model. furthermore, making model(conceptual + logical) is in together
