* many-to-many(order-product)
introduce junction table(order_item)
- identifying: order_item has pk(order_id,product_id)
  - pros
    - strict business logic: (order_id,product_id) is unique
  - cons
    - low flexibility
      - if one order_item can have an option of product, pk has to be changed (order_id,product_id,option_id)
      - complexity
- non-identifying: order_item has pk(order_item_id), unique(order_id,product_id)
  - pros
    - it has both of flexibility and integrity
    - orm friendly
