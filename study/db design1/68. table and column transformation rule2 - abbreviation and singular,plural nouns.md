* good abbreviation condition
- universality: popular and meaningful without context
- unambiguous
  - desc: description, descending
  - auth: author, authentication, authorization
- consistency & documentation: write in term dictionary

* bad abbreviation makes cost
- maintenance cost increase
  - what mem_reg_dt means?  
- bug occurrence rate increase: developer can mistake unclear abbreviation
  - what does auth mean in auth_status? 

* balanced guidelines 
core principle: removal of ambiguity
1. in table, omit table name prefix
- in many frequent join using the column, consider a table name prefix 
2. use popular abbreviation actively 
- identification -> id
- quantity -> qty
- average -> avg
- number -> no
- detetime -> dt(for conflict of suffix like _at, aggregation is needed)
3. if a name is very long, question that modeling is wrong
- in member table, primary_shipping_address_street_and_postal_code

* table name: singular noun vs plural noun
- plural noun argue
  - because a table is a set of records
  - `select * from members` is natural 
- singular noun argue
  - because a table defines the frame of an entity, entity name should be used
  - when orm is used, a class name can be mapped to table name easily 
- conclusion: there is no clear answer. but keep consistency

* reason why singular noun is common in Korea
- language characteristics
  - korean doesn't separate strictly between singular and plural noun
  - ex. user means one person or many people
  - prefer singular noun because it is natural in korean
- English grammar rules
  - irregular plural nouns are hard to use
  - like person/people, analysis/analyses 

* term dictionary usage
- in physical modeling, use the term dictionary to define table, column name
