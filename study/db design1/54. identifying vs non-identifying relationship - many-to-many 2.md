* many-to-many(order-product)
new requirement is coming 
- introduce options(L size, M size, black color)
- if option is different, then the user can order a product with different options  

* non-identifying relationship - high flexiblity
- changes
1. order_item add option_id column
2. unique constraint(order_id, product_id) is deleted
  - before, fk have to be deleted
3. add unique constraint(order_id, product_id, option_id)
  - after, fk can be added

* identify relationship - low flexiblity
- changes
1. order_item add option_id column
2. pk(order_id, product_id) is deleted -> it is very risky and hard to change
3. add pk(order_id, product_id, option_id)

* many-to-many summary
- a non-identifying relationship is more flexible
  - business rules can be changed easily. just changing unique constraint
  - pk(artificial key), unique(fk combination)
- identify relationship is strict
