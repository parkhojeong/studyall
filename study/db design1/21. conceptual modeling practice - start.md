* conceptual modeling practice - start

# step1: re-define core requirement(mvp)
- define mvp(minimum viable product)

- shopping mall mvp requirement
1. user: user can join. user manage their own information
2. product: product can be added, managed
3. order: user can order product.
4. payment: payment information for order can be stored and managed.
5. delivery: delivery state for order being paid can be managed

# step2: derive core entity
- member: customer use service
- product: target of sales
- order: user buying action result
- payment: paid information for order
- delivery: information of product movement for product ordered

* focus on order and delivery.
- order is business transaction until payment
- delivery independent process of logistics
- if separating a role like order and delivery, we can manage various states
  - like payment is completed but delivery is not started yet 

# step3: define attribute and relationship
- member: member_id, login_id, password, member_name, email, address
- product: product_id, product_name, product_price, stock_quantity
- order: order_id, order_status, delivery_address, order_date
- payment: payment_id, payment_method, payment_price, payment_status, payment_date
- delivery: delivery_id, delivery_status, tracking_number

* relationship
- between member and order : member can order once or more(1:n)
- between order and payment: one payment is done for one order(1:1)
- between order and delivery: one delivery is done for one order(1:1)
- between order and product: one order has many products. in contrast, one product is included in many orders(m:n)

# step4: resolve m:n relationship and associative entity
between order and product, introduce associative entity for m:n relationship.
does what an attribute means between relationship?
suppose a member orders 'product A' and 'product B' once.
then, a question is 
- how many product A is ordered?(order quantity) 
- how much is the product A price when ordered?(price at order time)
so, order quantity and price at order time are attributes only between order and product.
for resolving m:n relationship and store additional attributes, introduce order_item entity
by order_item, complex m:n relationship can be resolved to two simple 1:n relationships.
- order and order_item relationship(1:n)
  - one order can have multiple order_item
  - one order_item must belong to one order
- product and order_item relationship(1:n)
  - one product can be included in multiple order_item
  - one order_item must have one product

order(1) - (n)order_item(n) - (1)product

* memo: associative entity name recommendation and characteristics
1. connection emphasis: order_product
  - very intuitive and simple to recognize relationship
2. meaningful name
  - order_item
    - concisely show that item is in order
    - match business word
  - order_detail
    - similar to order_item
    - emphasize representing detail 
recommendation: meaningful name
