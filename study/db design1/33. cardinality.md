* cardinality
- mandatory relationship: require a row in a table that has a relationship
- optional relationship: allow a row not existed in a table that has a relationship

* fk and cardinality implementation
suppose table1(1) - table2(n)

1. optional relationship
- |O---O<
  - table1 has nothing to do 
  - table2 has fk(nullable) to table1 
2. mandatory relationship
- ||---|<
  - table1 has nothing to do 
  - table2 has fk(not null) to table1

* summary
- in many-to-one, one-side has nothing to do. 
  - because fk is managed by a many-side
  - so, it is resolved by the application layer
