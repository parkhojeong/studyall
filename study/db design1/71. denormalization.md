* why denormalization is needed: performance
- omitting join, select performance increased

* practice denormalization technique
1. duplicated column added
- problem: to show order product name in order history page 
  - always `order_item join product` is needed
- solution: add product_name in an order_item table 
- caution: data mismatch probability increased
- practice: by application logic or db trigger, product_name is updated automatically

2. aggregation column added
- problem: query 'total order price by user', always aggregation is needed
- solution: total_purchase_amount column added in user table
- caution: write workload increased

3. putting together table or partitioning
- putting together table: put together 1:1 or 1:n relationship in one table
- partitioning: if specific columns are often used, vertical partitioning is recommended

* in denormalization, data consistency maintenance method
1. application logic: after data updated, update related data
2. database trigger
3. batch job

* denormalization practice guide
1. don't hastily denormalize
2. prove it with performance test
3. consider read/write ratio
4. calculate tradeoff: performance vs maintenance cost
