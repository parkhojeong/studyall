* summary
- analyze requirement and identify core factors
  - conceptual modeling make blueprint for data world
  - noun would be entity or attribute, verb would be relationship
  - verb record derive entity.
    - ex. order record could be stored and managed
- what is entity?
  - target that we should store and manage, table of database
  - good entity has characteristics
    - business relevance, 2 or more attributes, set of instances, relationship to other entities
  - conceptual frame, each data is instance
- entity classification 1
  - by form of existence
    - tangible entity

    - event entity
  - by role and occurred point
    - key entity: user, product
    - main entity: order
    - behavioral entity: order history
  - event, behavioral entity has possibility that data increase rapidly. must consider index, partition, archiving strategy
- entity classification 2
  - by existence dependency
    - strong entity
    - weak entity
    - prevent orphan data. 
  - for resolve m:n relationship, associative entity is used
  - for inheritance hierarchy, supertype/subtype is used
- attribute and identifier
  - attribute: detail information entity has, column of table
  - identifier: attribute that uniquely identify instance(row) of entity. pk
- cardinality and optionality
  - cardinality: max relationship count between entity
  - optionality: participating relationship is optional or not
- erd completion
  - blueprint that show entity, attribute, relationship
  - crow's foot notation is de facto standard
- associative entity - resolve many to many relationships
  - m:n relationship can't be implemented by rdbms
  - introduce associative entity between two entities
  - resolve m:n relationship and provide to add additional attribute of relationship
- term dictionary
  - map business term to database term
  - define term based on minimum single word, and combine term
  - update consistently
