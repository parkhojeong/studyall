* wrong data type problem
- storage wasted
- performance degraded
  - db read in memory from disk.
  - if the data type is big, data to read at once is small.
  - it makes more disk i/o
- data integrity lost: wrong data inserted
  - ex. if data type is string for date, 'yesterday' or 'tomorrow' can be inserted.  

* string type
- varchar(n): variable length string. n is the max length of string.
  - length information is managed additionally(1~2bytes).
    - 1byte for 1~255,
    - 2byte for 256~65535.
  - pros: high storage efficiency
  - usage: almost string data. ex. name, title, address
- char(n): fixed length string. left padded with space.
  - pros: it can be faster than varchar.
  - cons: storage wasted
  - usage: phone number, gender(M/F), resident registration number
- TEXT: large string.
  - type: Maximum length, length prefix size 
  - TEXT: 64KB, 2byte
  - MEDIUMTEXT: 16MB, 3byte
  - LONGTEXT: 4GB, 4byte

* practice guid
- a variable length string: varchar 

* number type
- tinyint: 1byte
  - ex. age
- smallint: 2byte
- mediumint: 3byte
- int: 4byte
  - ex. normal id, stock quantity, view count
- bigint: 8byte
  - ex. pk

* decimal type
- DECIMAL(M,D): fixed length decimal number. for money
- DOUBLE, FLOAT: approximate decimal number.

* pk type: INT vs BIGINT
- storage difference is negligible. a million records use about 400mb/800mb 
- for scalability and consistency, use BIGINT.
