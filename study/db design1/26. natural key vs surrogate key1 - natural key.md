* natural key vs surrogate key1 - natural key

* what is natural key?
- using data that occurs naturally and has meaning
- pros
  - intuitiveness: a@a.com, 19900101-1234567
- cons
  - mutability
    1. fk violation occurs when change pk
    2. chained update: all related data must be updated
    3. data history damaged: snapshot data lost
      ex. when user order with a@a.com, but a@a.com isn't exist in db
    4. external system unsynchronization 

* mistake that never changed
- login_id will never change
- resident registration number will never change
- but, these can be changed

* conclusion: use surrogate key
