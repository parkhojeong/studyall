* one-to-one relationship - practice

- to put fk in detail, requirement 1:1 -> 1:n
```sql
create table member(
    member_id bigint primary key
);

create table member_detail(
    member_detail_id bigint primary key,
    member_id bigint unique not null references member(member_id)
);
```
- it needs only deleting unique constraint
- MySQL for using `drop index unique_constraint_name`, fk is deleted before and fk is added after
