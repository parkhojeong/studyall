* many-to-many relationship - rdbms limit

- m:n relationship can be implemented using two tables 
- rdbms constraint
  1. pk is unique
  2. fk reference single row
  3. column value must be atomic
- orders(m) - (n)product 
  - multiple product_id in orders can't be implemented
  - because fk reference only single row
