* design 3 steps - conceptual, logical, physical
- database design follow 3 steps
- 3 steps roadmap is map to give guidance to go

* design 3 steps - goal
1. conceptual design
  - goal: understand a business idea and requirements, sketch programming language from real world
  - core question: what data(entity) we handle? what relationship between them?
  - output: Entity-Relationship Diagram. blueprint to easily understand for human
2. logical design
  - goal: from conceptual design, making a structure adapted to relational database
  - core question: from conceptual model's factors, how do you represent table? what rule(normalization) should be applied? 
  - output: normalized table schema
3. physical design
  - goal: implementation optimized for specific database(MySQL)
  - core question: what type is used is the best efficient? how to use indexes?
  - output: sql script(create table ...)

1. conceptual model
  - goal: communication between business and developers. represent business domain abstractly 
  - aspect: real world, business domain
  - words: entity, attribute, relationship
2. logical model
  - goal: struct requirement based on relational database theory. make standard blueprint
  - aspect: relational database theory, data's logical structure
  - words: relation, attribute, tuple, pk, fk
3. physical model
  - goal: detail specification for implementation in specific dbms(MySQL)
  - aspect: actual performance, storage space, specific dbms technology
  - words: table, column, row, data type, index

* practice words
- as theoretically divide words, in practice, we don't use strictly
- table is commonly used instead of entity. column is used instead of attribute
- when we design for rdbms, we could mix conceptual design and logical design
