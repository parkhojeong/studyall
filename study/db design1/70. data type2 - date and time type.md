* date and time type
- date: only date 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  - ex. birthday 
- time: only time 'HH:MM:SS'
- datetime: date and time 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'
  - DATETIME
  - TIMESTAMP: 1970~2038 constraint

* practice guide
- use DATETIME instead of TIMESTAMP
- use created_at, updated_at

* updated_at, created_at automation
- DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

* business datetime vs automation creation time
- ordered_at: at the time that user ordered. a business behavior time 
- created_at: at the time that record created.
- comparison: user order(orderd_at) -> internal process -> record created(created_at) 

* other types
- boolean(or bool): internally it is handled to tinyint(1) 
- enum: commonly not used
- json
