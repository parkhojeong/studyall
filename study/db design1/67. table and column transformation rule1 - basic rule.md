* normal naming convention
1. english: non-english could have compatiblity issue to library and develeopment environment
2. lowercase + snake case(underscore): 
  - uppercase could have compatibility issue in specific operating system
3. clear and concise name: avoid abbreviation
4. consistent prefix and suffix: consistency increase readability
  - ex. all pk column name tablename_id
5. avoid using reserved word

* normal column name convention
1. pk name is tablename_id
2. fk name is same as pk name
3. in date/time column, use suffix for clear usage
- at: time event happened(system side). 'at a specific time'
  - when user orders something, system records the time automatically 
  - order time, cancel time, login time
  - ex. created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, logined_at, ordered_at, paid_at
- _datetime: date and time like reserved time that user selects  
  - ex. reservation_datetime  
- _date: date only
- _time: time only
4. boolean type column: is_ or has_ 
- ex. is_active, has_coupon, is_shipped
5. column has singular noun
6. meaningful abbreviation
7. show clear data characteristics
- unit, type specification
  - if service supports multiple currency, use currency unit like price_krw, price_use instead price
  - if service supports weight, use weight unit like weight_kg, weight_g instead weight
- context information: if column is used in multiple context, consider 'tablename_columnname'

* importance of consistency
- in project, consistency is the most important factor
