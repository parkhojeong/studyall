* many to many relationship and composite key

- when we resolve m:n relationship(order-product)
1. composite key(order_id, product_id)
- pros: logical clarity
- cons
  - high complexity: for join, need many columns 
  - fat key
  - low scalability: sub table has many keys
  - complexity to use orm
2. single surrogate key and unique to business constraint
- core idea
  1. be pk simple
  2. use unique to business constraint
- pros
  - low complexity: simple join only order_item_id
  - high flexibility and consistency: for reference order_item, use only order_item_id
  - keep data integrity by unique
  - simple to use orm
- cons
  - a bit overhead: additional index

* conclusion: use a single surrogate key for pk
