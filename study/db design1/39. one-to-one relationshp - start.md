* one-to-one relationship strat

* why use one-to-one relationship
1. performance optimization
- split table for additional data
  ex. user/user_detail
2. security reason: sensitive data
  ex. user/user_sensitive_info
3. optional information extension 
  ex. user/seller
4. different business model - different lifecycle or different team management
  ex. orders/delivery
  - pros
    - separation of concerns
    - scalability: extending delivery can be done independently and easily
    - dependency: orders <- delivery

- in logical modeling, implementation 1:1 relationship
main(pk) - sub(fk, unique)
