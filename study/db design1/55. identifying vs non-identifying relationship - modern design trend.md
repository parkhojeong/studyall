* past: identifying relationship preferred
- logical clarity
- storage space efficiency
- query optimization

* modern: non-identifying relationship preferred
1. flexibility & agility
  - loose coupling
2. simplicity & efficiency
  - pk is single surrogate key
3. orm friendliness
  - jpa/hibernate, django orm friendly
4. decoupling from business logic
  - pk is just for identifying a row

* modern design principle
1. pk: a single surrogate key(bigint auto_increment)
2. relationship: non-identifying 
3. business logic: unique constraint

* edge case: considering identifying a relationship
- complete weak entity
- the child table always is queried by the parent table
- business logic is never changed

* final summary
- core factor for good software design
  - flexibility
  - simplicity 
  - scalability
  - maintainability
- design
  - pk: surrogate key
  - natural keys: unique constraint
  - relationship: non-identifying
