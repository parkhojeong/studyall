* entity classification1

* classification by existence type: tangible, conceptual, event
1. tangible entity
things having physical existence. we can touch or see them.
  - characteristic
    - physical existence
    - easy to identify
    - relatively stable information
  - example
    - student, customer, professor(human)
    - product, car, building(physical object)
    - lecture hall, storage, office(physical space)
2. conceptual entity
concept or idea that should be managed in business
  - characteristic
    - abstract concept without physical existence
    - business rule or principle, classification rule
    - relatively stable information
  - example
    - department, organization, team(organizational structure)
    - account, insurance product(financial product and account book)
    - subject, department(education and classification hierarchy)
3. event entity
specific event or occurrence that occurred during a business process
  - characteristic
    - record behavior occurred during a business process
    - instance consistently generated by flow of time
    - many occurrences
  - example
    - order, contract(sale and contract event)
    - payment, deposit, withdrawal(financial event)
    - reservation, cancellation(service event)

* practice example
- if tangible/conceptual entity is main of design, system goal is maintaining data correctness and consistency.
- if event entity is main of design, system goal is recording event quickly and accurately

* how this classification helps us
- user, product is tangible/conceptual entity. but order is event entity.
- practice aspect: we can estimate that order entity will increase rapidly.
- when we design order table, we can make strategy
  - index strategy: if data is millions, select clause must need index 
    - find order by sepecific user(where user_id = ?)
    - find order by specific order_date(where order_date betwwen ? and ?)
  - data partitioning and archiving: 
    - partitioning is a technique to store data physically separated by order_date(ex monthly, yearly). storing together 5, 10 years ago order records is inefficient.
    - archiving is moving old data to archive storage or backup table. so, the active table is small and fast


* classification by role and occurrence timing: fundamental/key, main/center, action/behavior entity
1. fundamental/key entity
it exists independently and isn't generated by another entity.
normally, perform parent role of another entity
  - characteristic
    - can generate independently
    - perform parent role of another entity
    - has unique pk own self
  - example
    - user, product, employee, department
2. main/center entity
it is generated by fundamental/key entity, perform core role of business.
it represents business transaction between key entity
  - characteristic
    - generated by fundamental/key entity
    - perform core role of business
    - data creation is large, make many action entity
  - example
    - order, contract, sales
3. action/behavior entity
normally generated by two or more key or main entity, record detail info
  - characteristic
    - generated by key entity or main entity
    - record is often updated or increased quickly
  - example
    - payment history, log
    - order history(coupon use, point use, credit card use)

* practice example
1. communication cost decrease: clear and concise communication is possible
2. organized development order and planning management: key entity -> main entity -> action entity
3. performance and data management strategy making criteria
- entity characteristics mean data characteristics
- key entity(user, product): update is rare, commonly is read-heavy. indexing optimized for read is important
- main entity(order): data is generated consistently, select and update is frequent. 
- action entity(order history, payment history)
  - when order product if payment method is 3 types(credit card, point, coupon), 3 rows of payment history is inserted. heavy-insert and data size will increase rapidly.  
  - in beginning design, we should consider partitioning or archiving. if table is splitted by order_data monthly or quarterly, we could prevent performance issue.
