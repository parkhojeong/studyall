* various key types

- database design 3 steps
1. conceptual modeling: ERD
2. logical modeling: transform ERD to general rdbms
  - entity -> table
  - attribute -> column
  - identifier -> primary key
  - relationship -> foreign key
3. physical modeling: implementation to specific rdbms
  - column specific type
  - index
  - optimization to vendor specific

* various key types
- primary key
  - pk identify uniquely each row
  - pk rule
    1. not null
    2. unique
    3. immutable
  ex. member_id, product_id
- candidate key
  - candidates of pk
  - has unique and minimality
  ex. email, phone_number
- alternate key
  - candidate keys without pk
- foreign key
  - connect relationship between tables
  - reference pk of other table
  ex. orders.member_id reference member.member_id
