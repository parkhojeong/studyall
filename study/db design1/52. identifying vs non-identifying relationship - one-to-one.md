* one-to-one(member-member_detail)
- non-identifying: member_detail - pk:member_detail, fk:member_id(not null)
  - pros
    - loose coupling: if relationship(1:1 -> 1:N) is changed? easy. just deleting unique
    - consistency design
  - cons
    - additional unique index 
- identifying: comment - pk&fk(member_id)
  - pros
    - strict logical constraint
  - cons
    - low flexibility: if relationship(1:1 -> 1:N) is changed?
