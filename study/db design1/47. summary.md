* summary
- one-to-one - start
  - use case: performance optimazation, security, addtional information, separation of concerns
  - for 1:1 relationship, use unique fk key
- one-to-one - fk position
  - in a sub table(recommended) 
    - it follow ocp principle
    - it can be changed easily to one-to-many relationship
  - in a main table
    - low scalability
    - insertion logic is complicated
- one-to-one - [practice] flexity of extension relationship
  - by just deleting a unique constraint, the relationship is changed to one-to-many
  - a main table is not affected
- one-to-one - fk in a main table
  - when relationship optionality is mandatory, it is enforced by not null
  - when skipping join is needed
- m:n relationship - rdbms limit
  - rdbms can't implement m:n relationship with two tables
    - reason: atomicity, pk unique, fk reference a single row
- m:n relationship - junction table
  - rdbms resolve m:n relationship with junction table
  - a junction table has fk two tables
- m:n relationship - attributes
  - attributes for a relationship are stored in the junction table
- m:n relationship - conceptual, logical modeling
  - without attributes for a relationship, m:n is used as a conceptual modeling, but junction table is used as a logical modeling
  - with attributes for a relationship, junction table is used as a conceptual modeling
  - find attributes for a relationship
