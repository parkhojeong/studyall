* composite key design

- use natural key as composite key
  - cons
    - low flexibility: if pk changed, related all data will be changed
    - fk complexity, size increase
    - complexity of query and management: not intuitive
    - low scalability: if add new column as natural key, pk type can be changed
- alternative - surrogate key
  - pros
    - immutable: not related to business
    - simple fk reference: join with single column
    - high performance: low size
    - flexibility and clarity: separate pk role and business role(apply unique to natural key)

* summary
- pk is a surrogate key
- business constraint is by unique to natural key
