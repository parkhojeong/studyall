* many-to-one relationship - fk position1

* where to put fk?
- conclusion: put fk in child table

* trial to put fk in parent table
1. multiple fk in one column -> first normal form violation
  - ex. child_ids = child1, child2, child3
2. multiple fk in different columns -> low scalability, space wasted
  - ex. child_id1 = child1, child_id2 = child2, child_id3 = null

* parent table and child table in many-to-one relationship
- parent: table of one side. it has pk
- child: table of many side. it has fk
- dependency: child -> parent
