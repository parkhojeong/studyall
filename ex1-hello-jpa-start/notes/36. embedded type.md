* embedded type
- new value type can be defined
- in jpa, it is called embedded type
- it is called also composite value type
- Address 
  - street
  - city
  - zipcode

* embedded type usage
- @Embeddable: annotation in type definition
- @Embedded: annotation in a used field
- default constructor is required
- pros
  - reusability
  - high cohesion

* embedded type and table mapping
- embedded type is a just value of an entity
- find-grained mapping is possible 

* @AttributeOverrides
- if an entity has two or more embedded types
  - @AttributeOverrides is required for column name duplication
```java
@Embedded
@AttributeOverrides({
        @AttributeOverride(
                name = "city",
                column = @Column(name = "new_city")),
        @AttributeOverride(
                name = "street",
                column = @Column(name = "new_street")),
        @AttributeOverride(
                name = "zipcode",
                column = @Column(name = "new_zipcode"))
})
private Address newAddress;

@Embedded
private Address address;
```

* embedded type and null
- if the embedded type is null, the column value is also null
