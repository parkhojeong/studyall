* one-to-one
- owner-side must be a table that has a foreign key
- another side has mappedBy
  - it can't be the owner side
```java
// order(pk)-delivery(fk)
class Order {
    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "order")
    private Delivery delivery;
}
class Delivery {
    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "order_id")
    private Order order;
}
```

the main table has a fk
- pros
  - because the main-table has fk, to know fk exists can be known without joining
- cons
  - if optionality is optional, the field can be null
the sub table has a fk
- pros
  - flexibility to change the relationship(1:1 -> 1:N)
- cons
  - always need to join with the main table
