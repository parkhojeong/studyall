* common mistake
- owner does not value
```java
Team team = new Team("teamA");
em.persist(team);

Member member = new Member("memberA"); //owner
em.persist(member);
```
- member.setTeam(team) is required

* bi-directional relationship summary
- uni-directional relationship is completed for relationship mapping
- bi-directional mapping is just adding instance graph search
  - for jpql, reversed search can be required

* if bi-directional relationship is used, both must have value
- consider pure instance status, set value in both side
  - use relationship convenience method
- be careful of circular reference
  - toString(), lombok, json generation library

* relationship owner
- owner is decided by fk position
