* cascade
- when a related entity is also persisted
  - ex. when parent is persisted, child is also persisted
- types
  - ALL
  - PERSIST
  - REMOVE
  - MERGE
  - REFRESH
  - DETACH
- it is not related in relationship mapping
- it just provides convenience to persist related entities 

* orphanRemoval
- child entity that is not mapped to a parent entity is removed
- cause: only use it when a child is referenced from one parent, but not from another

* cascade + orphanRemoval
- if both are used, a parent manages a child entity lifecycle
- ex. ddd aggregate root
