* collection of value type
- Set<String>, List<Address>

```java
import jakarta.persistence.ElementCollection;

class Member {
    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name = "favorite_food")
    private Set<String> favoriteFoods = new HashSet<>();
    
    @ElementCollection
    @CollectionTable(name = "address")
    private List<Address> addresses = new ArrayList<>();
}
```
table
- favorite_food
  - member_id(pk, fk)
  - food_name(pk)
- address
  - member_id(pk, fk)
  - city(pk)
  - street(pk)
  - zipcode(pk)

* value type collection constraint
- value type does not have an identifier
- value type is hard to be tracked
- value is changed, all related data is deleted and recreated 


* value type collection alternative
- consider using one-to-many relationship
  - cascade + orphanRemoval
  - ex. List<Address> -> AddressEntity
