* relationship difference between class and table
class relationship can have 2 things
- member -> team (uni-directional)
- team -> member (uni-directional)
table relationship - 1 thing
- member <-> team (bi-directional)

* relationship owner
mapping rule: an owner is who manages fk
- owner
  - can read and write(insert, update) fk
  - @JoinColumn is required 
  - use table with fk as owner
- not owner 
  - can only read
  - has mappedBy property for owner assignment
