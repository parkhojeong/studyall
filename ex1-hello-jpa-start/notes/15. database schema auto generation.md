* database schema auto generation
- ddl is created at application boot time
- ddl is for specific db vendor by db dialect
- don't use production

* hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto
- create: drop and create
- create-drop: same as create but drop at application shutdown
- update: changed part is modified
  - don't use in production
  - table is locked
- validate: validate entity and table is mapped correctly
- none: no action
  - any words are ok
  - ex. asfsdf is same as none

* caution
- in production, don't use create, create-drop, update
- in development early stage, use create or update
- in test server, use update or validate
  - use update carefully
- in production and staging, use validate or none 

* ddl generation function
it only is used for ddl generation, but not for jpa execution in runtime 
- column constraint: @Column(nullable=false, length=10)
- unique constraint: define unique constraint in entity
```java
@Table(uniqueConstraints = {@UniqueConstraint(name="name_unique", columnNames = {"name"})})
class User {
}
```
- use column and table constraint for easy-to-check constraint
