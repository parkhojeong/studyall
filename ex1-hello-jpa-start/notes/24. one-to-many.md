* one-to-many
- one-side is the owner side
- another side is read-only
```java
// member-order
class Member {
    @OneToMany
    @JoinColumn(name = "member_id")
    private List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>();
}

class Order {
    @ManyToMany
    @JoinColumn(name = "member_id", insertable = false, updatable = false)
    private Member member;
}
```

* summary
- normally, use many-side as owner side
- read-only field by `insertable = false, updatable = false`
