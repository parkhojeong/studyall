* inheritance relationship mapping
- in rdb, inheritance does not exist
- the supertype/subtype relationship is mapped to the inheritance structure
    - supertype/subtype table: join strategy
    - combined table: single-table strategy
    - each table: table-per-concrete-class strategy

* main annotations
- @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.xx)
    - JOINED
    - SINGLE_TABLE
    - TABLE_PER_CLASS
- @DiscriminatorColumn(name="xx")
- @DiscriminatorValue(value="xx")
