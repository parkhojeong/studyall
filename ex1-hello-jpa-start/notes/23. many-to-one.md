* 3 considerations for relationships mapping
1. multiplicity(cardinality)
2. direction(bi-direction, uni-direction)
3. owner side

* multiplicity
- many-to-one(one-to-many)
- one-to-one
- many-to-many

* direction
- table
  - join with fk
  - the concept of a direction doesn't exist
- class
  - if the reference field exists, a uni-directional relationship is made

* owner side
- the side that owns the relationship
- the side that has the foreign key
- another side can read-only

* many-to-one
- many-side is owner side
- another-side is not owner side
```java
// member - order
class Order {
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "member_id")
    private Member member;
}
class Member {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "member")
    private List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>();
}
```
